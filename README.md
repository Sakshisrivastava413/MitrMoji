## मित्रMOJI

### Abstract: 
A fun and interactive game for the vernacular audience of India to connect with strangers & make some friends.

### Problem Statement: 
It's hard to make new friends and open up at the very first meeting. Also, It happens with all of us that sometimes we have nothing to talk about but we still want to carry on with the conversation.

### Our Solution: 
A simple mobile-based game which can help people connect to strangers in a fun and engaging manner.
We are delivering mobile gaming + video chatting experience - मित्रMOJI targeting vernacular people of India. It will be their fun partner to spend time and interact with nearby strangers. 

Once logged in, matchmaking will happen where the user will be paired with a stranger for the game. As the game starts both players are connected for a video chat and as they talk they see some emoji-icons being popped up on their screen & they have to replicate the emoji expression using their faces in order to get points. A player who covers points greater than 200 wins and the game gets over but the video chat remains for the people to connect and talk as per their convenience.
